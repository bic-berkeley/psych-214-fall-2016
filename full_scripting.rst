Scripting of SPM analysis with nipype
#####################################

Requirements:

* :doc:`saving_images`;
* :doc:`introducing_nipype`;
* :doc:`spm_slice_timing_exercise`;

Can you write a Nipype script to do all the pre-processing in SPM?

You are doing an analysis for the following scans:

* :download:`ds114_sub009_t2r1.nii`; (functional);
* :download:`ds114_sub009_highres.nii` (structural).

In the following, remember you can explore the individual Nipype objects like
this:

>>> from nipype.interfaces import spm
>>> slice_timer = spm.SliceTiming()
>>> slice_timer.help()
Use spm to perform slice timing correction.
...

The script should do the following, using nibabel and Nipype:

* copy the structural image with a prefix of ``c`` because SPM will modify the
  image during registration (it modifies the image affine);
* drop the first 4 volumes from the functional run.  Save the new functional
  image with a filename prefix of `f`.
* run slice timing, assuming an ascending interleaved slice acqusition order
  (0, 2, ..., 1, 3, ... assuming 0-based indexing).  See
  :doc:`spm_slice_timing_exercise` for details.  The resulting funcitonal
  image will have a filename prefix of `af`;
* run motion correction estimation, and write out the mean image across
  volumes.  You will need ``nipype.interfaces.spm.Realign``.  The mean image
  will have filename prefix `meanaf`.   Hint: to write only the mean image,
  you need a ``inputs.write_which`` value of ``[0, 1]``.  See the script
  fragment below;
* estimate the registration of the structural image to the mean functional
  image: ``nipype.interfaces.spm.Coregister``;
* register the (registered) structural image to the template and write the
  slice-time corrected functional image with these estimated parameters:
  ``nipype.interfaces.spm.Normalize12``.  SPM calls this "spatial
  normalization". The resulting functional image will have a prefix of `waf`.
  Hint: I've put suggested values for the ``bounding_box`` input parameter in
  the script fragment below;
* smooth the spatially normalized 4D functional image by 8mm FWHM:
  ``nipype.interfaces.spm.Smooth``.  The resulting functional image will have
  the prefix `swaf`.

Your script will likely start something like this::

    """ Script to run SPM processing in nipype
    """
    import shutil

    import nibabel as nib

    # Import our own configuration for nipype
    import nipype_settings

    import nipype.interfaces.spm as spm

    # Start at the original image
    base_fname = 'ds114_sub009_t2r1.nii'
    structural_orig = 'ds114_sub009_highres.nii'
    structural_fname = 'cds114_sub009_highres.nii'

    # Copy the structural, because SPM will modify it
    shutil.copyfile(structural_orig, structural_fname)

    # Analysis parameters
    TR = 2.5
    slice_time_ref_slice = 1  # 1-based indexing
    n_dummies = 4
    # Realign "write_which" input. The 0 means 'do not write resampled versions of
    # any of the individual volumes`.  The 1 means 'write mean across volumes after
    # motion correction'.  See config/spm_cfg_realign.m in the SPM12 distribution.
    write_which = [0, 1]
    # Normalize write parameters.  Bounding box gives extreme [[left, posterior,
    # inferior], [right, anterior, superior]] millimeter coordinates of the voxel
    # grid that SPM will use to write out the new images in template space.  See
    # spm_preproc_write8.m for use of the bounding box values.
    bounding_box = [[-78., -112., -46.], [78., 76., 86.]]

When you have finished, have a look at the solution script at
:download:`nipype_ds114_sub009_t2r1.py`.
