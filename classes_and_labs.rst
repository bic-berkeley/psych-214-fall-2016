Classes and labs
################

The initial plan for this course was that we would use the classes (on Monday,
for 3 hours) for the main teaching, and the labs (Thursday, 90 minutes) for
practical exercises, but in fact we ended up using both sessions in about the
same way.

labs, see :doc:`labs`.
