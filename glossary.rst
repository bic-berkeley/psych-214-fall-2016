    PATH
        The list of directories in which your system will look for programs to
        execute.  See PATH_.  When you type a command such as ``ls`` at the
        terminal prompt, this will cause your :term:`shell` to look for an
        :term:`executable` file called ``ls`` in a list of directories.  The
        list of directories is called the system PATH.  Specifically these
        directories are listed in the value of an :term:`environment variable`
        called ``PATH``. Assuming you are using the default Unix ``bash``
        shell, you can see these directories by typing:

        .. code-block:: bash

            echo $PATH

        at the terminal prompt, followed by the return key. This might give
        you output like this:

        .. code-block:: bash

            /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/X11/bin

        The shell will search this list of directories in order for an
        executable file called ``ls``: first ``/usr/bin``, then ``/bin``, and
        so on.  We can ask to see the full path of the program that the system
        finds with the ``which`` command:

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ which ls
            /bin/ls

        This tells us that the system did not find a ``ls`` executable file in
        ``/usr/bin``, but did find one in ``/bin``, for a full path of
        ``/bin/ls``.

    shell
        A shell is a program that gives access to the computer operating
        system.  It is usually a "command line interface" program that runs in
        a terminal, accepting strings that the user types at the keyboard.
        The shell program interprets the string and executes commands.  The
        most common default shell program is ``bash`` |--| for Bourne-Again
        SHell, so-called because it is an expanded variant of an older shell
        program, called the Bourne shell.  For example, when you open a
        default terminal application, such as ``Terminal.app`` in OSX or
        ``gnome-terminal`` in Linux, you will usually see a prompt at which
        you can type.  When you type, the program displaying the characters
        and interpreting them is the *shell*.  When you press return at the
        end of a line, the shell takes the completed line, and tries to
        interpret it as a command.  See also :term:`PATH`.

    environment variable
        An environment variable is a key, value pair that is stored in
        computer memory and available to other programs running in the same
        environment.  For example the ``PATH`` environment variable, is a key,
        value pair where the key is ``PATH`` and the value is a list of
        directories, such as ``/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin``.
        In particular, the shell uses the value of the ``PATH`` environment
        variable as a list of directories to search for executable programs.

    executable
        A file is *executable* if the file is correctly set up to execute as a
        program.  On Unix systems, an executable file has to have special
        :term:`file permissions` that label the file as being suitable for
        execution.

    file permissions
        Computer file-systems can store extra information about files,
        including file permissions.  For example, the file permissions tell
        the file-system whether a particular user should be able to read the
        file, or write the file or execute the file as a program.
