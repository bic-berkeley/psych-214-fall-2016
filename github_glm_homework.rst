GLM exercise, with some github practice
#######################################

This exercise follows the same form as the :doc:`github_pca_homework`.

As before:

* Make sure you have logged into your Github account;
* Go to the `course github organization`_ page.  You should see a private
  repository with a name like `yourname-glm-exercise` where ``yourname`` is
  your first name.
* Fork this repository to your own account;
* Clone your forked repository;
* Change directory into your new cloned repository::

    cd yourname-glm-exercise

* Make a new branch to work on, and checkout this new branch::

    git branch glm-exercise
    git checkout glm-exercise

* Finish the GLM exercise by filling in ``on_estimation_code.py``, including
  writing the text answers into the strings in the code file;

* When you've finished, commit ``on_estimation_code.py``, and push these
  changes to your github fork;

* Make a pull request to the upstream repository.

Any problems, please feel free to contact JB or I.

Good GLMing.
