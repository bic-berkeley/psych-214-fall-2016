Unless we state otherwise, all Python, R and MATLAB code files in this
repository are covered by the license in the file UNLICENSE.  Put simply, we
the code files into the public domain.

The data in ``camera.txt`` comes from reading the file ``camera.png`` in the
scikit-image ``data`` directory, and writing the read values out to a text
file.  I (MB) could not find a copyright statement or license for it, but many
image-processing packages use it, and it appears to be in the public domain.

The brain image data come from two OpenFMRI datasets:

* dataset ds107 : https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000107
* dataset ds114 : https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000114

The files from the ``ds107`` and ``ds114`` datasets are covered by a Public
Domain Dedication and License version 1.0 :
http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1.0/ . We release all derivative
images in this repository under the same license.

The data from the anatomical image stored in ``anatomical.txt`` is from
dataset ``ds114``. It is a version of ``sub009/anatomy/highres001.nii.gz`` from
which I (MB) have loaded the data and written the data to a text file.  The
other brain images have the following provenance:

* ds107_sub001_highres.nii : uncompressed version of
  `sub001/anatomy/highres001.nii.gz` from ds107;
* ds107_sub012_highres.nii : uncompressed version of
  `sub012/anatomy/highres001.nii.gz` from ds107;
* ds107_sub012_t1r2.nii : uncompressed version of
  ``sub012/BOLD/task001_run002/bold.nii.gz`` from ds107;
* ds114_sub009_highres.nii : uncompressed version of
  `sub009/anatomy/highres001.nii.gz` from ds114;
* ds114_sub009_t2r1.nii : uncompressed version of
  ``sub009/BOLD/task002_run001/bold.nii.gz`` from ds114;
* ds114_sub009_highres_moved.hdr : header from ds114_sub009_highres.nii file
  with transformations applied from `move_ds114_anat.py`;
* ds114_sub009_highres_moved.img : copy of ds114_sub009_t2r1.nii

These files:

* rotated_volume.nii
* secret_rotated_volume.nii

are modified versions of the first volume in the ``ds107_sub012_t1r2.nii`` BOLD
data file, with modifications applied from the script ``make_rotated.py``.
