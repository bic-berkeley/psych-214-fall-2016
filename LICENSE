The data in ``camera.txt`` comes from reading the file ``camera.png`` in the
scikit-image ``data`` directory, and writing the read values out to a text
file.  I could not find a copyright statement or license for it, but many
image-processing packages use it, and it appears to be in the public domain.

The data from the anatomical image stored in ``anatomical.txt`` is from the
OpenFMRI project, dataset ``ds114``: https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000114 . It
is a version of ``sub009/anatomy/highres001.nii.gz`` from which I (MB) have
loaded the data and written the data to a text file.

The data for the anatomical image `ds107_sub001_highres.nii` is an
uncompressed copy of ``sub001/anatomy/highres001.nii.gz`` from OpenFMRI
dataset ``ds107`` https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000107.

The BOLD data ``ds107_sub012_t1r2.nii`` comes from the OpenFMRI project
dataset ``ds107``: https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000107 . It is a
decompressed and renamed copy of ``sub012/BOLD/task001_run002/bold.nii.gz``.

The BOLD data ``ds114_sub009_t2r1.nii`` comes from the OpenFMRI project dataset
``ds114``: https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000114 . It is a decompressed and
renamed copy of ``sub009/BOLD/task002_run001/bold.nii.gz``.

The files from the ``ds107`` and ``ds114`` datasets are covered by a Public
