#: Our usual imports
import numpy as np  # the Python array package
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # the Python plotting package

#- Load image object using nibabel
#- Turn off nibabel memory mapping.

#- Get image array data from image object

#- Get the 10th volume and show shape

#- Standard deviation across all voxels for 10th volume

#- Get standard deviation for each volume; then plot the values

#- Read global signal values calculated by SPM, and plot

#- Apply algorithm for SPM global calculation to first volume

#- Make an `spm_global` function that accepts a 3D array as input,
#- and returns the global mean for the volume according to the SPM
#- algorithm

#- Write a function `get_spm_globals` that returns the global values 
#- for each volume
