Docstrings
##########

Quoting from the `Python glossary`_, a docstring is a "A string literal which
appears as the first expression in a class, function or module.".

A :doc:`string literal <string_literals>` is a string contained within quotes
or triple quotes.

Here is a docstring in a function:

>>> def func(arg1):
...     "This is the function docstring"
...     return arg1 * 4

It is useful to write docstrings for several reasons:

* the process of writing the docstring forces you to explain the function to
  yourself, and therefore write clearer code with better design;
* you and others using your function can read the docstring to see how to use
  your function;
* Python (via "help()") and IPython_ (via "func?") can read the docstring and
  return it to you, when you are working interactively;
* there are good tools, such as Sphinx_, that can process the docstrings to
  make attractive documentation. See :ref:`documentation-guidelines`.

Using docstrings
****************

You can use docstrings at your interactive Python or IPython prompt:

>>> help(func)
Help on function func:
<BLANKLINE>
func(arg1)
    This is the function docstring
<BLANKLINE>

In fact Python puts the docstring into the ``__doc__`` attribute of the
function:

>>> print(func.__doc__)
This is the function docstring

One of the most useful features of IPython_ is its ability to return
docstrings when you add a question mark and press return after the name of the
function you are interested in:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: def func(arg1):
       ...:     "This is the function docstring"
       ...:     return arg1 * 4
       ...:

    In [2]: func?
    Signature: func(arg1)
    Docstring: This is the function docstring
    File:      ~/<ipython-input-2-0233609cddfb>
    Type:      function
