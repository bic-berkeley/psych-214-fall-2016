************
Terminal.app
************

We'll be typing at the "terminal" prompt often during the class.  In OSX, the
program giving the terminal prompt is ``Terminal.app``.  It comes installed
with OSX.

Press the Command key and the spacebar at the same time to open the Spotlight
search box.  Type "terminal" and press return to open Terminal.app.  You
should get a terminal window.  Consider pinning Terminal.app to your dock by
right-clicking on the Terminal icon in the dock, chose "Options" and "Keep in
dock".

********************
The Atom text editor
********************

Download the Atom installer for Mac from the https://atom.io.  Go to your
Downloads folder and click on the Downloaded ``atom-mac.zip`` file.  This will
unzip the files into your Download folder.  You should now see an Atom icon
for the ``Atom.app`` application folder in your Downloads, maybe something
like this:

.. image:: images/atom_downloaded.png

Open a new Finder window, navigate to the Applications folder, and drag the
``Atom.app`` folder to the Applications folder.

Double-click on the Atom folder icon in the Applications folder to open Atom
for the first time.  At the dialog "Atom.app is an application downloaded from
the Internet. Are you sure you want to open it?", select Open.  Atom should
now be installed.

See also `installing atom`_.

***
Git
***

On Mavericks (OSX 10.9) and above, ``git`` comes with the Apple OSX command
line tools.

To get these, type ``git`` at the terminal command line.  If git is not
installed already you will get a dialog box like this:

.. image:: images/git_developer_tools.png

Click 'install' to install the OSX developer command line tools, including
git.

If you have an earlier version of OSX, please install the most recent version
of git from this `git OSX installer`_ page.

********
Homebrew
********

Homebrew_ is "The missing package manager for OSX".  It is a system for
installing many open-source software libraries packages on OSX.  I recommend
Homebrew to any serious Mac user.

To install Homebrew, follow the instructions on the `homebrew home page
<homebrew>`_.

Python and packages
*******************

A standard way
==============

This is the way that I (MB) installed on my Mac laptop, so it will be easiest
for us to support you if you do the same thing.

Install Python 3 with Homebrew
------------------------------

In :ref:`terminal.app`, type::

    brew install python3

Confirm that you have Python 3 and the Python 3 package installer ``pip3``
commands correctly placed into one of the directories that your system
searches for programs, with these commands and their expected outputs:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ which python3
    /usr/local/bin/python3
    $ which pip3
    /usr/local/bin/pip3

Set up user installs
--------------------

The standard correct way to use ``pip`` (and, in our case) ``pip3`` is to
install packages into your user's environment, rather than into the main
system that is shared across users.  This is called a pip "user" install.

If you have Python 3.5, a user install on OSX will put the package files into
a set of directories starting with ``~/Library/Python/3.5``, where ``~``
refers to your home directory.

Packages may have command line programs.  These will be installed to
``~/Library/Python/3.5/bin``.  You need to put this directory on your
:term:`PATH`. To do this, start :ref:`Terminal.app` and type:

.. code-block:: bash

    atom ~/.bash_profile

This will open the Atom editor and load the file ``.bash_profile`` from your
home directory.  ``.bash_profile`` is a text file that contains commands that
will run every time you open a new Terminal.app Window or tab.  At the end of
this file, add these lines:

.. code-block:: bash

    export PATH="$HOME/Library/Python/3.5/bin:$PATH"

Save and close Atom.  Quit and reopen Terminal.app in order to reload the
``.bash_profile`` configuration.  Check the PATH is correct with:

.. code-block:: bash

    echo $PATH

The value you see should start with the path to the ``Library/Python/3.5/bin``
sub-directory in your home directory.

Install the packages you need as user
-------------------------------------

Type this at the terminal prompt::

    pip3 install --user numpy scipy matplotlib ipython nibabel jupyter

Check that these have installed, and that your PATH is correctly set, with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ipython

at your terminal (bash) prompt.  You should see something like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ipython
    Python 3.5.2 (default, Jul 28 2016, 21:27:57)
    Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

    IPython 5.1.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python.
    ?         -> Introduction and overview of IPython's features.
    %quickref -> Quick reference.
    help      -> Python's own help system.
    object?   -> Details about 'object', use 'object??' for extra details.

    In [1]:

Type ``quit`` and press return to exit the IPython program.

Other ways
==========

There are various other ways to install Python 3 and the Python packages.  If
you already have a version of Python 3 that you are using, you are welcome to
use that instead of Homebrew Python.  For example, you might prefer to use the
big installer package called Anaconda_ from Continuum Analytics to install
your Python and other packages.
