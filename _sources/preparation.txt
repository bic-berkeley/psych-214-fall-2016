We are going to be using the following major software for the class:

* Python 3;
* numpy_ (the Python array package);
* matplotlib_ (Python plotting package);
* scipy_ (Python scientific library);
* nibabel_ (read / write of neuroimaging file formats in Python);

For the class and homework we will use:

* the Aton_ text editor with the hydrogen_ plugin for interactive code:
* the git_ version control system.

See:

* :doc:`installation_on_osx`;
* :doc:`installation_on_linux`;

You will also need one of:

* MATLAB installed on your laptop or;
* an account on the `neuro cluster`_ (so you can run MATLAB / SPM_ remotely).
