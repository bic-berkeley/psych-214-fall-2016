Pitches for your project proposals - see :doc:`projects`.

********
Teaching
********

* the neural and hemodynamic model;
* the concept of a hemodynamic response function (HRF);
* designing an HRF;
* using convolution with the HRF to make a BOLD regressor;
* modeling FMRI signal with multiple regression and the BOLD regressors;
* investigating assumptions behind the HRF and linear time invariance.
* smoothing;
* t contrasts;
* using multiple regressors
* allowing for different onsets with the HRF temporal derivative;
* investigating power and bias for correlated regressors;
* modeling the baseline;
* selecting models;
