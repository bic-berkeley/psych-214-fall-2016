October 24: the HRF, inference on statistical maps
##################################################

This page is currently the combination of stuff we have not yet covered.  We
will move much of this stuff into the following days.

********
Teaching
********

* modeling FMRI signal with multiple regression and the BOLD regressors;
* investigating assumptions behind the HRF and linear time invariance.
* smoothing;
* t contrasts;
* using multiple regressors
* allowing for different onsets with the HRF temporal derivative;
* investigating power and bias for correlated regressors;
* modeling the baseline;
* selecting models;

********************

* `Tutorial on correlated regressors`_;
* `Introduction to smoothing`_;
* `Smoothing as convolution`_.
* the `Bonferroni correction`;
* thresholding with `Random fields`_;
* thresholding with the `False Discovery Rate`_;
* Eklund et al 2016 :cite:`eklund2016cluster`.
