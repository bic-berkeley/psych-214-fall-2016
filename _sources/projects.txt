We designed this class to teach you:

* the ideas and practice of functional MRI analysis;
* how to work efficiently with your computer;
* how to collaborate with code and analysis;
* making your work reproducible.

During the class you'll see us put a constant emphasis on collaboration for
learning and for increasing the quality of your work.

The best way to learn this, is with a substantial shared project.  So, a major
part of this class is the final project.

For examples of projects in a previous class, please see
https://github.com/berkeley-stat159, in particular:

* https://github.com/berkeley-stat159/project-alpha
* https://github.com/berkeley-stat159/project-beta

You'll notice that these analysis are fully reproducible |--| the students had
to provide instructions that their graders could follow to reproduce their
whole analysis, including their project figures.

Mentors
*******

A major part of collaboration is learning to learn from your more experienced
peers.  We are expecting that they, in turn, will learn from you.

Each project will have a graduate student or post-doc mentor.  See
:doc:`mentors` for the instructions we give to the project mentors.

Of most use to you will be to find a mentor that you will work with later in
your Berkeley career.  If you have an idea which lab you will be working with
after this course, please try and find a mentor from that lab.  Please point
potential mentors at the :doc:`mentors` page and tell them to get in contact
with us as soon as possible.
