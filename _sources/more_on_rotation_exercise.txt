Check the you have :download:`rotations.py` in your current directory, or
elsewhere on you Python path:

Your task...
************

I have taken a copy of the first volume in ``ds107_sub012_t1r2.nii``.

.. nbplot::

    >>> #: the first volume of ds107_sub012_t1r2.nii
    >>> img_4d = nib.load('ds107_sub012_t1r2.nii')
    >>> data = img_4d.get_data()
    >>> vol0 = data[..., 0]

Then I rotated it by:

* 0.1 radians around the x axis, then;
* 0.2 radians around the y axis, then;
* 0.3 radians around the z axis.

.. nbplot::

    >>> #: the resulting rotated image
    >>> rotated_img = nib.load('rotated_volume.nii')
    >>> rotated_vol0 = rotated_img.get_data()
    >>> rotated_vol0.shape
    (64, 64, 35)

Here are slices over z, y, and x, for rotated and not-rotated images

.. nbplot::

    >>> #: slices on z, y, and x axis for original and rotated images
    >>> fig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 2, figsize=(10, 15))
    >>> axes[0, 0].imshow(vol0[:, :, 17])
    <...>
    >>> axes[0, 1].imshow(rotated_vol0[:, :, 17])
    <...>
    >>> axes[1, 0].imshow(vol0[:, 31, :])
    <...>
    >>> axes[1, 1].imshow(rotated_vol0[:, 31, :])
    <...>
    >>> axes[2, 0].imshow(vol0[31, :, :])
    <...>
    >>> axes[2, 1].imshow(rotated_vol0[31, :, :])
    <...>

Of course, I have to be more specific by what I mean when I say that I rotated
this image by:

* 0.1 radians around the x axis, then;
* 0.2 radians around the y axis, then;
* 0.3 radians around the z axis.

I am describing the mapping from coordinates in ``vol0`` to coordinates in
``rotated_vol0``.

As you now know, in order to apply this rotation, I needed to do *pull
resampling*, so I needed to use the mapping from coordinates in
``rotated_vol0`` to coordinates in ``vol0``. So *applying* this rotation
involved: rotation of -0.3 radians around z, then -0.2 radians around y then
-0.1 radians around x.

Your task, should you chose to accept it, is to make a new image, where you
have undone the given rotations.

Let's remind ourselves of what we need to do.

In order to make the new fixed image, we will need to

1. Make a new empty image the same shape as the original;
2. For every coordinate :math:`(i, j, k)` in this new empty image, we are
   going to apply a transformation :math:`t`. This transformation will give us
   the corresponding coordinate :math:`(i', j', k')` in the ``rotated_vol0``;
3. We use linear resampling to estimate a voxel value :math:`v` for coordinate
   :math:`(i', j', k')` in ``rotated_vol0``;
4. We put this voxel value :math:`v` into the empty image at coordinate
   :math:`(i, j, k)`.

In fact `scipy.ndimage.affine_transform`_ will do all these steps for us, but
we need to supply the transformation :math:`t`.

So |--| what transformation do we need?

We are doing pull resampling - so we want the mapping from coordinates in
``vol0`` to coordinates in ``rotated_vol0``.

Your job is to make ``M`` |--| a 3 by 3 matrix that applies this mapping.

See `rotation in 2d`_ and :doc:`rotation_2d_3d`.

``M`` is the matrix that ``scipy.ndimage.affine_transform`` will use to get
the transformation between coordinates in the new empty image and the
corresponding coordinates in the rotated image.

.. nbplot::

    >>> #- Make a 3 by 3 transformation matrix that applies this sequence
    >>> #- * 0.1 radians around the x axis, then
    >>> #- * 0.2 radians around the y axis, then
    >>> #- * 0.3 radians around the z axis.

Use ``scipy.ndimage.affine_transform`` to create the new image and use the
transform to sample from the rotated image:

.. nbplot::

    >>> #- Use affine_transform to resample from `rotated_vol0` using the transform.
    >>> #- Get the result into a variable `derotated_vol0`

.. nbplot::

    >>> #- plot slices from the image to see if you got the right transformation.
