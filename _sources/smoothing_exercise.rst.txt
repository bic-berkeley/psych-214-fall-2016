*************************
Smoothing and convolution
*************************

Start by smoothing in 1D. We first load a functional image
(:download:`ds114_sub009_t2r1.nii`), and get the first volume:

.. nbplot::

    >>> #: get first volume from functional
    >>> import nibabel as nib
    >>> img = nib.load('ds114_sub009_t2r1.nii')
    >>> data = img.get_data()
    >>> vol0 = data[..., 0]

Get a plane of the first volume by taking a slice on the third dimension:

.. nbplot::

    >>> #: get slice over third dimension
    >>> mid_slice = vol0[:, :, 14]
    >>> plt.imshow(mid_slice)
    <...>

Get one line of this slice, from left to right, from the middle of the brain:

.. nbplot::

    >>> #: get middle line from middle slice
    >>> mid_line = mid_slice[:, 25]
    >>> plt.plot(mid_line)
    [...]

We are going to start by smoothing this line.  This is smoothing in one
dimension.

Here is the ``fwhm2sigma`` function from the page `smoothing as convolution`_:

.. nbplot::

    >>> #: Full-width at half-maximum to sigma
    >>> def fwhm2sigma(fwhm):
    ...     return fwhm / np.sqrt(8 * np.log(2))

Here is a test that the function returns an expected result:

.. nbplot::

    >>> #: Test output of fwhm2sigma for a single FWHM
    >>> assert np.allclose(fwhm2sigma(4), 1.698643600576)

We are going to smooth by 8 pixels full-width at half maximum (FWHM), so we
need the corresponding ``sigma`` (standard deviation):

.. nbplot::

    >>> #- sigma for FWHM 8?

We use the probability density function (PDF) of a `Gaussian distribution`_
for our kernel:

.. math::

   f(x, \mu, \sigma) = p e^q

where:

.. math::

   p = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \\
   q = -\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}

To make our smoothing kernel, we can sample the PDF, for a given $\mu$ and
$\sigma$.

We can use ``scipy.stats`` to sample from the PDF.

.. nbplot::

    >>> #: import the Gaussian (normal) distribution function
    >>> from scipy.stats import norm
    >>> norm_pdf = norm.pdf

Next we need to make our smoothing kernel from values in the Gaussian PDF:

* Work out the +/- limit for the kernel x values with ``limit = round(sigma *
  4)``
* Make a vector of integers ``x`` to sample the PDF from ``-limit`` to
  ``limit`` - *inclusive*;
* Sample the PDF at these x values, for :math:`\mu = 0` and given
  :math:`\sigma`, to get the ``kernel`` vector;
* Plot the x values against the y values;
* Work out how many elements there are from the start of the ``kernel``
  vector, to the value corresponding to $x=0$ |--| this is the
  ``kernel_offset``.

.. nbplot::

    >>>
    >>> #- Work out the +/- limit for the kernel x values;
    >>> #- Make a vector `x` to sample the PDF;
    >>> #- Get `kernel` vector by sampling the PDF at these x values (mu=0);
    >>> #- Work out `kernel_offset`.

Now we can convolve the line from the image plane with the ``kernel``. We take
the result starting at ``kernel_offset``:

.. nbplot::

    >>> #- Convolve image line with kernel
    >>> #- Slice out the result we want using kernel_offset
    >>> #- Plot smoothed with unsmoothed line

Smoothing the whole image slice is a simple extension.  It turns out that we
can apply smoothing in two dimensions, by first applying the smoothing to each
line in one dimension. Then we take the output of this smoothing and apply the
smoothing to the second dimension.

* Make a new array the same shape as ``mid_slice`` called ``smoothed_slice``;
* Loop over the first dimension of ``mid_slice``, and fill each line of
  ``smoothed_slice`` with the smoothed version;
* Loop over the second dimension of ``smoothed_slice`` and replace each line
  with the smoothed version;
* Show.

.. nbplot::

    >>> #- Make a new array `smoothed_slice` for smoothed output
    >>> #- Loop over first dimension applying kernel as above
    >>> #- Loop over second dimension of smoothed image, applying kernel
    >>> #- Show with `imshow`

We can do the same thing with ``scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter``.

.. nbplot::

    >>> #: import gaussian_filter
    >>> from scipy.ndimage import gaussian_filter

Have a look at the help for ``gaussian_filter``.

Use ``gaussian_filter`` to make another smoothed version of ``mid_slice``.

.. nbplot::

    >>> #- Use gaussian filter to smooth `mid_slice`

Subtract the ``gaussian_filter`` version from your handcrafted version.

Can you explain the difference?

.. nbplot::

    >>> #- Subtract two versions of the smoothed slice, show
