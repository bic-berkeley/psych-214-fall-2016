Tools for generating exercises
##############################

I (MB) designed this repository to be used as a submodule in other
repositories containing exercises.

The exercises are of the same form as for the `Google Python exercises
<https://github.com/psych-214-fall-2016/google-python-exercises>`_.

These tools generate the exercises from the solutions.
