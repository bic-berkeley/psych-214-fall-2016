The Atom text editor
********************

Download the Atom installer for Windows from the https://atom.io.  Go to your
Downloads folder and click on the Downloaded ``atom-mac.zip`` file.  This will
unzip the files into your Download folder.  You should now see an Atom icon
for the ``Atom.app`` application folder in your Downloads, maybe something
like this:

.. image:: images/atom_downloaded.png

Open a new Finder window, navigate to the Applications folder, and drag the
``Atom.app`` folder to the Applications folder.

Double-click on the Atom folder icon in the Applications folder to open Atom
for the first time.  At the dialog "Atom.app is an application downloaded from
the Internet. Are you sure you want to open it?", select Open.  Atom should
now be installed.

See also `installing atom`_.

You will also need the hydrogen_ plugin for Atom.  Install from
:ref:`Terminal.app` with:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Install dependencies with homebrew
    brew install pkg-config zeromq
    # Install the plugin
    PYTHON=python2.7 apm install hydrogen

Git
***

On Mavericks (OSX 10.9) and above, ``git`` comes with the Apple OSX command
line tools.

To get these, type ``git`` at the terminal command line.  If git is not
installed already you will get a dialog box like this:

.. image:: images/git_developer_tools.png

Click 'install' to install the OSX developer command line tools, including
git.

If you have an earlier version of OSX, please install the most recent version
of git from this `git OSX installer`_ page.
