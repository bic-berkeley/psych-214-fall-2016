Dummy coding GLM exercise
#########################

This exercise follows the same form as :doc:`github_pca_homework` and
:doc:`github_glm_homework`, with the minor difference that this time - you
don't have the solutions on the main web page.

As before:

* Make sure you have logged into your Github account;
* Go to the `course github organization`_ page.  You should see a private
  repository with a name like `yourname-dummies-exercise` where ``yourname``
  is your first name.
* Fork this repository to your own account;
* Clone your forked repository;
* Change directory into your new cloned repository::

    cd yourname-dummies-exercise

* Make a new branch to work on, and checkout this new branch::

    git branch dummies-exercise
    git checkout dummies-exercise

* Finish the dummy coding exercise by filling in ``on_dummies_code.py``,
  including writing the text answers into the strings in the code file;

* When you've finished, commit ``on_dummies_code.py``, and push these changes
  to your github fork;

* Make a pull request to the upstream repository.

Any problems, please feel free to contact JB or I.

Happy dummy GLMing.
