This exercise follows the same form as :doc:`github_pca_homework` and
:doc:`github_glm_homework`.

As before:

* Make sure you have logged into your Github account;
* Go to the `course github organization`_ page.  You should see a private
  repository with a name like `yourname-multi-model-exercise` where
  ``yourname`` is your first name.
* Fork this repository to your own account;
* Clone your forked repository;
* Change directory into your new cloned repository::

    cd yourname-multi-model-exercise

* Make a new branch to work on, and checkout this new branch::

    git branch multi-model-exercise
    git checkout multi-model-exercise

* Finish the dummy coding exercise by filling in ``multi_model_code.py``;

* When you've finished, commit ``multi_model_code.py``, and push these changes
  to your github fork;

* Make a pull request to the upstream repository.

Any problems, please feel free to contact JB or I.

Happy multi-modeling.
