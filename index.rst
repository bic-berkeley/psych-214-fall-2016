*******************
Fall semester 2016.
*******************

This is a hands-on course teaching the principles of functional MRI (fMRI)
data analysis. We will teach you how to work with data and code to get a
deeper understanding of how fMRI methods work, how they can fail, how to fix
them, and how to develop new methods. We will cover the basic concepts in
neuroimaging analysis, and how they relate to the wider world of statistics,
engineering and computer science. At the same time we will teach you
techniques of data analysis that will make your work easier to organize,
understand, explain and share. At the end of the course we expect you to be
able to analyze fMRI data using Python and keep track of your work with
version control using git.
