Project mentors
###############

Each group of students in this class will be doing a significant project
analyzing FMRI data.

See :doc:`projects` for the student instructions.

As a mentor, you will be helping the students to design a project, and propose
it in the class.

When we've agreed on the project, you will be the first point of call for
advice on the neuroscience and the analysis.

We want you to make yourself available for at least one hour per week to meet
with the students, during the semester.  You'll need to budget a couple of
hours for reviewing and commenting on the students work as it develops on the
web, using github.com.

Please see the :ref:`project-examples` of projects from a previous class to
get an idea of the kind of work we are expecting.

Later on, I am sure your students will be asking for more time and help, as
the project deadlines come nearer |--| see the project :ref:`project-timing`
for the relevant dates.

You will be helping the students to choose a project.  We expect the students
to do about 40 hours of work each, in groups of 2 or 3.  Many projects will be
exploratory, in that they start off by exploring a particular dataset, and may
continue to evaluate a previous analysis, and / or analyze the dataset in a
new way.

It is possible that some projects will turn out to be publishable or part of a
paper, in which case we expect both student and mentor to be authors.

We :ref:`instructors` are always happy to hear from you, and answer any of
your questions, and pitch in to discussions with students.

We know this will be a significant amount of work for you, and as a thank you,
we will buy you a textbook of your choice at the end of the course.
