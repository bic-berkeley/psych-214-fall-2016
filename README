Psych 214 fall 2016 website
###########################

Website for the psych-214 fall 2016 course on functional MRI methods.

We built the website with Sphinx: http://www.sphinx-doc.org.

To build and uplaod the website::

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    # Build the site locally
    make html
    # Upload to the website
    make github

Before publishing pages, make sure the doctests pass:

    make clean
    make doctest

The exercises are built from template files with extension ``.tpl``.  These
templates contain the solution, and markup for building the exercise page,
with much of the solution code removed, and a code template for the students
to fill in.  Building of the solutions and exercises and code templates
happens via the ``make html`` etc ``make`` steps, but you can trigger the
build explicitly via ``make rst-exercises``.

See the ``tools/proc_rst.py`` script for the format of the ``.tpl`` files.
See the existing ``.tpl`` files for examples.

To add a new exercise:

* write a ``.tpl`` file e.g. ``some_concept.tpl``;
* add the root filename of the ``.tpl`` file to the ``TEMPLATES`` list in the
  ``Makefile`` - e.g. ``some_concept``;
* The build will make ``some_concept_exercise.rst``,
  ``some_concept_solution.rst`` and ``some_concept_code.py``.  Point to
  ``some_concept_exercise`` in a page, e.g. with
  ``:doc:`some_concept_exercise```.

See the ``LICENSE`` file in this directory for copyright and your rights to
